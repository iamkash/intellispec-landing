# Adding Featured Images to Case Studies

## Why the image isn't showing:

Your case study currently doesn't have a `featuredImage` field set. The image placeholder you see is because the `featuredImage` field is `null` in your Sanity data.

## How to add a featured image:

### 1. Open Sanity Studio
- Go to `http://localhost:3001/studio`
- Navigate to "Case Studies" in the left sidebar

### 2. Edit your case study
- Click on your Chevron case study: "3 Days Saved, Zero Surprises: How Chevron GOM Streamlined Their Turnaround with intelliSPEC"

### 3. Add Featured Image
- Scroll down to the "Featured Image" field
- Click the upload button or drag & drop an image
- Choose an appropriate image related to:
  - Oil & Gas industry
  - Industrial inspection
  - Chevron logo (if you have permission)
  - Generic industrial equipment
  - Or any professional business image

### 4. Configure the image
- **Hotspot**: Click and drag to set the focal point of the image
- **Crop**: Adjust the crop area if needed
- **Alt Text**: Add descriptive alt text for accessibility

### 5. Save and Publish
- Click "Publish" to make the changes live
- The image will now appear on your case study page

## Image Recommendations:

### Size & Format:
- **Recommended size**: 1200x600 pixels (2:1 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **File size**: Under 2MB for fast loading

### Content Suggestions:
- Industrial inspection equipment
- Oil & gas facility images
- Professional business imagery
- Chevron branding (if permitted)
- Generic industrial settings

### Alternative: Use Content Images
If you don't want to add a featured image, you can add images directly in the content using the rich text editor. These will appear within the article content.

## Troubleshooting:

### Image still not showing:
1. Make sure you clicked "Publish" after adding the image
2. Check that the image field is not empty
3. Verify the image format is supported
4. Clear your browser cache and refresh

### Image quality issues:
1. Use higher resolution images (1200x600 or larger)
2. Ensure the image is not blurry or pixelated
3. Check that the hotspot is set correctly

### Performance:
1. Keep file sizes under 2MB
2. Use WebP format for better compression
3. Consider using multiple sizes for responsive images

## Next Steps:

Once you add a featured image, it will automatically appear on:
- The individual case study page
- The case studies listing page
- Any other pages that reference this case study

The image will be automatically optimized and served in the correct size for different devices.
